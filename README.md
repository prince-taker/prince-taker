### 👋 About Me

- I’m a Computer Science / Data Science graduate from South Africa who loves **backend** work and strong system design.  
- I care more about **secure, reliable programs** than the flashiest UI – if it runs in production, it must behave.  
- I’ve done well in **hackathons and datathons**, and I enjoy turning messy, real‑world problems into structured, working solutions.  
- Long term, I’m aiming at a career where **Java, security, AI/data, and solid engineering discipline** all meet.

### 🛠️ Tech & Tools

- **Languages:** Java (favourite), JavaScript/Node.js, Python, SQL  
- **Backend & APIs:** Java backend, Spring Boot (learning), REST APIs  
- **Data & ML:** Data analysis, feature engineering, basic ML workflows, dashboards  
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server (academic)  
- **Other:** Git/GitHub, Docker (for Java apps), Linux, documentation (SDLC, SDD, UML)

### 🚀 Selected Highlights

- 🥇 **DIRISA Student Datathon (Technical Challenge – 1st place)**  
  Built a driver risk scoring system on real telematics data, turning raw GPS and sensor streams into usable safety scores for South African fleets.

- 🏆 **Multiple Hackathon Wins & Podiums**  
  Performed strongly in university and industry hackathons (including borehole/water projects and agentic AI themes), often by pushing non‑generic, high‑impact ideas under tight timelines.

- 💡 **ThinkAble – Final‑Year Software Engineering Project**  
  Led the design of a full system, including detailed **SDLC** and **System Design Document**, and focused on reliability, security, and clear architecture over “just making it work.”

### 😎 Hot Take & How I Work

> Hot take? Java is the best language ever, I don't care man haha.

- I won’t always write you the *prettiest* app, but I’ll write you a **secure program**, that’s for sure.  
- I’m very **detail‑oriented**: I like understanding how every part of a system fits together and why it behaves the way it does.  
- I think **outside the box** and can usually tell when an idea is generic – that’s a big reason I’ve done well in hackathons.  
- I don’t run away from being a **leader**: I like to know what everyone in the team is doing, help unblock them, and keep the overall quality high.

### 🎬 When I’m Not Coding

Even when I’m not coding, I’m usually still on my laptop.

- Catching up on series and movies  
- **Dark** on Netflix is my favourite series ever  
- Reading, learning, or just thinking through new ideas for future projects
